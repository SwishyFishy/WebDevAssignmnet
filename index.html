            <p>Hi! I'm Jonah. I'm a 20 year old, third-year computer sciences student at Trent University, and I work as a manager at McDonalds. I have two cats, Inigo and Dave, and I enjoy playing video games and Magic: the Gathering in my free time.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <h2>My Job</h2>
                <p>I've worked at JCI McDonalds for almost three years now, and recently got promoted to manager. It's a workplace I'd highly recommend for students like myself, with flexible hours and good opportunities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <h2>My Cats</h2>
                <p>Inigo (no, not Indigo) and Dave are both Devon Rexes, 7 and 8 years old respectively. Inigo is smoky, with a black face, and spends more time in my bed than I do. He needs lots of scritches and snuggles, and has a delightful purr. Dave is far more independent, often disappearing for days on end, reappearing only sparingly to eat. He has an exquisite purr, but to hear it is a rarity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>I play plenty of different games, but my favourites (currently!) are The Binding of Isaac: Repentance, Deep Rock Galactic, and Team Fortress 2. Typically I enjoy movement-based first person shooters, like TF2 and DOOM Eternal, and rogue-likes, like The Binding of Isaac and Risk of Rain 2.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="description">
                <h2>Magic: The Gathering</h2>
                <p>Magic: the Gathering is my favourite game. My preferred way to play is the Commander format, which is a variant ruleset for 4 players wherein each player builds their deck around a 'Commander' which they can play again (for an extra price) if it's destroyed.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I'm also the President of Trent University's Magic: the Gathering club! You can find us at <span class="email">trentmtgcommunity@gmail.com</span>. We host weekly meetings for Trent students to get together on campus and play Magic, and occasionally we host free-to-enter limited events!</p>

        <h3>My Favourite MtG Decks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4><a href="https://www.archidekt.com/decks/3668238/shorikai_control" target="_blank">Shorikai, Genesis Engine Control</a></h4>
                <p>This deck is my pride and joy. It uses its commander to draw additional cards, and nearly half of the deck is comprised of cards that I can use to defend myself. It aims to stop other players from winning, exhaust their options, and then capitalize by playing a powerful combination of cards that can win the game on the spot, but require plenty of time to set up.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><a href="https://www.archidekt.com/decks/4255505/magar" target="_blank">Magar of the Magic Strings Spell Animation</a></h4>
                <p>This deck uses a card with a unique ability as its commander. The eponymous Magar lets me turn my spells into creatures that cast copies of themselves when they deal damage to my opponents, letting me double (or triple, or septuple) up on obscenely powerful spells that can typically only be cast once.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><a href="https://www.archidekt.com/decks/2540442/the_bosh_rebuild" target="_blank">Bosh, Iron Golem Artifact Combo</a></h4>
                <p>This deck has very little capacity to interact with its opponents. Instead, it plays 30-40 cards that interact with each other in ways that can 'go infinite' - a term for when a player is able to 'loop' some of their cards to do something an arbitrary amount of times. It aims to do this to generate infinite amounts of mana, which it can use to cast and activate its commander as many times as it needs to to win the game. What makes it so much fun is that because there are so many cards that can contribute, it's often reminiscent of a jigsaw puzzle trying to assemble a combo on the fly.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My Proudest Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My position as a manager in my workplace.</li>
            <li>In fewer than two years, I grew the Trent Magic: the Gathering club from 3 members to 15, organizing events and maintining club relations with the TCSA, the governing body of Trent's clubs, with a small and ever-rotating collection of fellow executive officers.</li>
            <li>I've achieved Dead God in the Binding of Isaac: Repentance. This achievement is earned by completing all 636 other achivements, including winning runs to all endings with all of the hardest characters.</li>
